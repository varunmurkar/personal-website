Okay, I don’t mean like, to kill time while Adobe XD updates. I mean, learn from them. 

Yeah, learn from video games. 

Don’t snort in derision just yet. Hear me out. It's gonna get nerdy.

## Baby Steps / Onboarding

Whether it’s fast-paced action or a gripping storyline or both (Uncharted, you beauty), players don’t have the time or patience to understand complex mechanics, no matter how lovingly designed. 

Think back to the days of Super Mario. 

You start with an idyllic countryside in the background. As you move right (obviously), you see the first floaty-floaty brick for our Italian plumber to headbutt. Curious, you tentatively jump. Ah, the sweet _ding_ of your first coin collected. 

A little further ahead, you get your first mushroom. Oh, you’re bigger now. Neat. You see your first enemy. You instinctively jump over it. But 8-year-old you isn’t that coordinated yet. You touch the enemy. But that’s okay, the game says - it’s not punishing you. It’ll let you continue playing. It’ll just make you smaller again.

8-year-old you could probably handle Worlds 1-5 no problem. 

Imagine, if instead the same made you start right back from the start of Level 1 when you died. 8-year-old you would be very, very annoyed. 

The point of this long-winded anecdote is how applications we design should handle onboarding. The reason games like Super Mario, Tomb Raider, Halo, etc. were so popular is that they were super effective in allowing even the newest players to enjoy the game. They didn’t assume you knew everything, and they didn’t overwhelm you by throwing everything at you at once. 

They held your hand as they took you through the basics, all while keeping you in the game, not a dumb tutorial level. 

They didn’t punish you for getting things wrong the first time. 

Speaking of which --

## Sandboxing / Introducing new features

Let’s look at Half Life 2 as another example. Every time a new enemy is introduced, the game first shows it to you from a safe distance, with the means to dispose of it. 

For example, when you first encounter the zombies, you find a sawblade blocking your way. As you pick it up using your Gravity Gun (the game already having shown you how to do that), a zombie shambles in front of you unexpectedly. You reflexively press the trigger, and the sawblade launches ahead, chopping the zombie in half. That’s the Petyr Baelish level of manipulation through which the game shows you the best way of dealing with the zombies.

## Heuristics (a.k.a. expectations)

When Halo: Combat Evolved was released in 2001, it revolutionised first-person shooters. For example, players no longer had to cycle through their whole inventory to select a grenade, aim it, and then throw it. Instead, just hit one button, and the Master Chief would lob one wherever you were pointing. 
This pioneered the gameplay mechanics for generations of games which would come after it.

Sounds similar?

That’s the genius of the game designers identifying a routine action, and simplifying it so the user can focus on tactical gameplay rather than fumbling with their keyboard for a simple action.

Heuristics extend beyond “Delete should be red”. These design patterns, through repetition and prevelance, have let the users know what to expect. So when something doesn't behave the way they expect, that creates a point of friction.

This plays out in 2 parts. _Setting_ expectations, and then _ensuring_ those expectations are met every time/

### Immersive Gameplay / Consistency

So you see, consistency goes beyond "all my buttons are the same size". Your product has to _behave_ consistenty.

Imagine you're playing Skyrim, a game about dragons set in a medieval pseudo-Nordic world, when suddenly, Thomas the Tank Engine rolls up in the hood. 

That’s what the gaming nerds call immersion-breaking. 

The example is exaggerated, but you get the point. 

For a counter to this example, look at a game like Deus Ex/Mass Effect.

### Emergent Gameplay / Expected Behaviour 

When left to their own devices, players will form their own strategies/tactics for achieving their objective. For example, whether to clear out this next enemy camp like Rambo or like a stealthy ninja. 

But to do that, players have to be able to predict how each element of their plan is going to behave. Good games handle this masterfully.

Take Halo for example. The lowly Grunts will almost always run away to their squad terrified when they see you or if their Elite commander is killed. The Elites will mostly charge at you in a rage when they’re about to die. The Hunters are always in pairs. If one dies, the other one will go berserk and trample everything in sight, its allies included. 

This behaviour is more or less consistent throughout the game. This allows players to plan their actions accordingly. Pinned down around a corner? Chuck a plasma grenade at a Grunt and watch it run towards its friends, taking them all out. Tight space and low on ammo? Just focus on taking out one Hunter and let the other one do the work for you in its grief. 

Now, imagine if an “Add” button in an app behaved differently on every other screen. Your user wouldn’t know what to expect, and would be unpleasantly surprised every single time. Until they eventually get too frustrated, uninstall your app, and if they’re having an extra-bad day, also give you a 1-star rating. 

## In Part 2 --

This would end up being a loooooong read. So I decided to split this into parts. That way, if I figure out more things from video games in the future, I can just add another part (scalability, eh?) ![showing off like a coolio](https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/google/223/dancer_1f483.png)
In Part 2, let's have a look at --
- How video games protect players from themselves
- Positive and negative feedback loops
- Why uncharted doesn't need a compass
