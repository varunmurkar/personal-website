description: Articles talking about the rules/laws of design are dime-a-dozen. Put related things together, reduce the number of clicks, add more whitespace, etc. But how realistic are they?

If you're any kind of designer, chances are you've read articles which elaborate on the principles of design. Among these are articles which talk about some of the laws to be followed when you're designing interfaces. 

These rules or laws are quite useful in making sure your design is sensible. [Full list here](https://lawsofux.com/). 

As someone who's been designing interfaces before being introduced to these principles, they sound perfectly sensible. Frankly, some just sound like stuff no one should need to formally tell you.

The rules exist, IMO, to crystalise or articulate what would be common sense when designing for humans. Related items being grouped together is not something you'd (as a user) give a second thought to. 

But imagine if the "Send" button in a WhatsApp chat was instead in the top right corner of the screen. Thankfully, most designers are sensible enough not to do something like that. But these rules exist as a good hygiene check for those who might be new to interaction design (or even as a sanity check for experienced designer). 

As far as rules like these go, their real value is in knowing how to "bend" them. When you're talking about UX, these rules are often useful to intentionally break things, depending on the context.

For example, your mobile phone. The SIM tray pin could've been another button next to the power button. Would've made gestalt sense. But it's a bad idea when you need to idiot-proof things from accidents.

Same goes for industrial tools like a baler.

You have the feed slot, the controls in a logical layout. But the main control to start it would be way offset to the right. 
Sounds dumb, right?

But that's intentional.

Because it forces the operator to take their hand away from the feed slot, preventing accidental amputation.

> Just knowing the rule isn't enough. You have to know how to apply it (and when not to).

(about whitespace in enterprise apps like dashboards)

Another trend you'll see quite often are bright dashboard designs with plenty of whitespace. 

These Dribbble shots look great, but present some practical issues in real-world usage. For example, in a B2B dashboard, tables usually deal with a large volume of data. When you add copious amounts of whitespace, the amount of data you can fit in a view of a table drastically reduces. 

It sounds counterintuitive, considering most design how-to's will tell you to be liberal with whitespace. But in a setting where you need to be able to rapidly process large amounts of data, large gaps between rows aren't helping. Just use banded rows.
