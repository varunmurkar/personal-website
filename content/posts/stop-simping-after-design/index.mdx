Over the last 5 years or so, design as a part of business has pretty much exploded. That's not to say it didn't exist earlier. Of course it did. But it wasn't as pervasive or valued in business as it has become. 

For the most part, this has been a welcome change. Things moved away from engineer-led cockpit designs to more user-friendly interfaces. Usability and aesthetics finally got their due.

Business, marketing, design, and development all worked in harmony.

Until the Design Simps attacked.

## Rise of the Design Simps

Slowly, but surely, power corrupted the design simps, as it always does. Their t-shirt collars slowly elongating into turtenecks. The increasing capabilities of web technology fueling their hunger.

And above all, a feverish belief that the path of the righteous designer will one day eradicate all suffering in the world. These zealots can usually be safely ignored. 

However, it starts becoming a problem when these simps start touting design as a fix-all panacea to businesses. Inevitably, it fails, and much like a nasty breakup, the businesses are left with a bitter experience and unwillingness to try again (or maybe I'm projecting ðŸ¤·). 

## Your job is to help the business, not the other way around

The business does not exist to satisfy your urges as a designer. Your role as a designer exists to improve the experiences for the *business's* users. Your role **does not** exist in a vacuum. You're there to improve the value the business providers for its customers, so that the business can in turn make more money due to happier customers. We need to overcome the notion that design as a business function exists to be a sole voice for the users. Frankly, in most cases, the Customer Support department will know more about this than you will. 

## You're not above the development team

Another thing I see are designers thinking their role is somehow at a higher level than the lowly developer grunts.
