Put down the pitchforks. Let me explain.

## What "empathy" means

## The current state of "empathy in design"

## So what went wrong?

## Okay. So what _should_ empathy in design look like?

## But my professor said I should empathize MAXXX!

Empathy has become a overused buzzword designers are obsessed with using. 
It's become an umbrella term which doesn't really mean anything anymore.
No matter what you do, you're not going to know and understand exactly what someone else thinks and feels. 
You can, at best, understand how 1 person you're designing for is going to feel.
But you're not designing for 1 person. 
You're designing something that will be used by a lot of people with their own unique way of thinking and feeling. 
The decision of "where should this button go" is not driven by empathy. 
You cannot quantify the argument of "the user will feel X due to Y".
So is empathy garbage?
Well, no. 

But the focus needs to be on the practicality of the task the users are trying to accomplish. Empathy has to mean being considerate of your users' capabilities. 
Are they colour-blind? Are they a college student or an 83-y/o retiree? Should the text on the app be large or small? Which colours can you use? Will your ride-sharing app include a safety feature?
That is what you're designing for.
These design decisions come from designing for the task users are trying to do, and improving your designs based on usage patterns, not on what you think they feel.
Slapping a cute emoji on your UI won't solve your problem.
