Hi, you curious little rebel. 

Seriously, who reads an About page? (flattered though `･ﾟ✧(ꈍᴗꈍ)✧･ﾟ` )

I started out as a freelance web developer. In most cases, design-driven development was yet unheard of. In the cases there was *some* design influence, since web designers at the time yet came from a print background, most of my time was spent in fixing the designs to work in code/for displays.

Cue me realising that I'm actually enjoying designing interfaces more. 

From simple landing pages to full-fledged websites to complete applications, I learnt more by reverse engineering others' designs and understanding the why and how. 

Nearly 8 years in, I work with banks, enterprises, and startups to build their product experiences into something that helps the brand establish a meaningful relationship with its customers. 

As a product designer, I'm involved with things at a client's business level, the overall strategy, data & analytics, service design, UX/UI, and engineering. It's taxing, but in a very rewarding kind of way.

And here I am, sharing things I've learnt and am learning along the way. :)
